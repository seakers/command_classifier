Three main approaches
Top-down, using parametric Cost Estimation Relationships
Bottom-up, using Work Breakdown Structure
Analogy, using nearest neighbor estimation + correction factors
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) requires large amount of information that may not be available in architecture stages
Performance of top-down and analogy depend on the existence of a good database of past systems that are similar enough to the current one
Most real cost models are a mix of these approaches: there is some high-level decomposition of the cost into different activities (WBS) and then estimates based on historical data and/or models (CER or analogy) for the individual activities
