Lifecycle cost estimation
To estimate the cost of a mission, you must think holistically about cost throughout the systemâ€™s lifecycle
Development cost
including any technologies
Implementation / Fabrication cost
Testing cost
Launch cost
Operations cost
Disposal cost
Separate out non-recurring (one-time costs to develop, fabricate and test a qualification unit) from recurring costs
incurred for every unit produced such as fabrication, launch and ops
When appropriate, consider the effects of inflation, discounting, learning and economies of scale
